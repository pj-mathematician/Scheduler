# Scheduler
Scheduler made in kivy language using kivyMD library


Note: 1) make a localsql.py file including the connection object as mycon

      2) The user at the time has to make a new line for adding details of 
         the user to his local server as we haven't followed the same order
         of attributes in the table.
